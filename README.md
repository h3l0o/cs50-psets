# CS50x 2025 Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions for the **CS50x 2025 problem sets**, implemented primarily in C. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem set from the course.

---

## Problem Sets Overview
- **pset1/week1** – *Cash*: Calculate the minimum number of coins for change using the Greedy algorithm.
- **pset1/week1** – *Credit*: Validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.

## NOTE: 
This is my first time actually trying to learn c seriously, so these solutions are not optimized, made with best practices, or even probably correct sometimes, it's just for my own progress tracking and/maybe it'll help other people to get some new ideas.
