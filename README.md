# CS50x 2025 Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions for the **CS50x 2025 problem sets**, implemented primarily in C. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem set from the course.

## Problem Sets Overview
- **pset1** – *8. Cash*: Calculate the minimum number of coins for change using the Greedy algorithm. (less comf problem)
- **pset1** – *8. Credit*: Validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.                     (more comf problem)

- **pset2** - *1. Scrabble*: Calculate points for Scrabble-like game using provided points system.
- **pset2** - *2. Readability*: Evaluate texts and tell which grade level they are using The Coleman-Liau index equation.

## NOTE: 
This is my first time actually trying to learn c seriously, so these solutions are not optimized, made with best practices, or even probably correct sometimes, it's just for my own progress tracking and/maybe it'll help other people to get some new ideas.
